---------------------
Over the millennia, infectious diseases have changed and evolved again, causing mankind great suffering. The "Big Three" infectious diseases, which include tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV/AIDS, are among the most deadly infections in the world since they cause the most infections and fatalities each year (Makam et al., 2021). The Global Fund has been working and making contributions to the battle against these three fatal diseases in light of these frightening circumstances. 
Programs for education and public awareness can be used to make a group of people aware of these diseases. Posters, radio or television programs, as well as online social media platforms, are all possible formats for this kind of endeavor. One of the most significant and effective methods of prevention is raising public awareness. to convey important preventative messages to your target demographic (youth, adults, or children) and motivate them to take precautionary measures against certain diseases (Start, 2000).

The study of public awareness and impact deals with human behavior and is influenced by a variety of elements, including culture, family, state, and education. Measurement and evaluation of the results of awareness-raising efforts in a timely, efficient, and systematic manner continue to be difficult. Currently, there is no platform to use a social listening approach to understand the impact of GF activities on HIV, TB and malaria awareness efforts. Through systematic investigation, we propose to use natural language processing models to analyze social big data to understand the impact of GF activities more deeply using social listening methods, and we expect that our model can provide some inspiration and help to solve this challenge and move the field forward.

Solution
 
Methodology: It is a challenge to effectively and systematically assess the effects of awareness-raising initiatives. Through systematic investigation, we propose to use natural language processing models to analyze social big data to understand the impact of GF activities more deeply using social listening methods.
